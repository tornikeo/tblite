What do we say?

# Slide 1

Recall the situation. 
Mass spectrometry is useful, but expensive.

# Slide 2

Mass spectrometry data is scarce. 
Physics is known - why not simulate?

# Slide 3

Simluation is tough. We make it better, with GPUs.

But, we only manage to address one part of the full puzzle!

# Slide 4

Our part, optimize this function:

===
Input: xyz of atom nuclei (where atoms are)
Output: xyz gradient (where atoms go)
1. Initialize basis
3. Build quantum representation of the system (**This thesis**)
4. Solve the system (self-consistent loop) (**Future work**)
